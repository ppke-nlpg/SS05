# SS05
The original SS05 algorithm from Hong Shen and Anoop Sarkar used in the paper 'Voting Between Multiple Data Representations for Text Chunking'



We would like to thank professor Anoop Sarkar for his cooperation and providing the original Perl code and letting us to use and distribute it with our own. This helped a lot to understand their algorithm better.
